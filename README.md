# PANDA
Code made by me for Robotic Arm (features automatic and manual controls) for Junior Design Project. The project requirements are to design, build, program, and demonstrate a computer-controlled PAP robot that can function both autonomously and through manual input. It also requires using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, servo motors, and at least 1 stepper motor.
